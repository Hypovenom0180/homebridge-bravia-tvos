# Debugging

If you have any issues with the plugin or TV services then you can run homebridge in debug mode, which will provide some additional information. This might be useful for debugging issues.

***HomeBridge with debug mode:*** ```DEBUG=BraviaPlatform,BraviaPlatformApi``` and ```homebridge -D ```
